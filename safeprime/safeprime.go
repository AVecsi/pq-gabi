Here we include a proof of the statement above based on the argument from
https://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/34c4abf63568a8eb, and on "Algorithms to Compute a
Generator of the Group (Z_p^*,Ã—_p) and Safe Primes", Pinaki Mitra, M Durgaprasada Rao and M Kranthi
Kumara, International Journal of Information Processing, 2(1), 29 - 35, 2008.

Theorem: If (and only if) q is prime and 2^(2q) = 1 mod (2q+1), then 2q+1 is a safe prime.

Proof: The "only if" direction follows immediately from Fermat's little theorem. Thus, suppose that
q is prime and that the equation holds. Consider the order of 2 within the multiplicative group of
the integers modulo p := 2q + 1. Since 2^(2q) mod (2q+1) = 1, the order must divide 2q. Since q is
prime, the only divisors of 2q are 1, 2, q and 2q, so the order of 2 must equal one of these. It
cannot be 1 or 2, since p must be at least 5, so the order equals either q or 2q. Either way, q
divides the order.

Now the order of any element must divide the order of the group, so q also divides the order of the
multiplicative group mod p. Additionally, 2 divides the order of this group, because as is easily
seen, p-1 has order 2. If q > 2 then since gcd(2, q) = 1 it follows that 2q divides the order of the
group (and even if q=2 this holds since it's true for p=5). The order of the group cannot be larger
than 2q = p - 1, so it must be equal to 2q = p - 1, which only happens if p is prime. QED

Note that because of the "only if" direction of the theorem, sieving safe prime candidates using
this equation does not sieve out any safe primes.
